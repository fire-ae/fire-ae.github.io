## Accessibility of Research and Materials

A separate guidance and statement document will be prepared for this section. Currently, concise image/table captions, clear writing, color-blind friendly figures are strongly recommended. 

<div align="justify">
  
One place to consult is W3C's Web Access Initiative's [Web Content Accessibility Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). Another place to follow is Cornell University's arXiv's webinars on the subject.

## Availability of Research and Materials

<div align="justify">
  
Data Availability: The best and easiest way is making the data available in a repository or directly in supplementary materials. When the critical data simply can't be made available on the grounds of its terms of use from the data source, how this data was obtained with which options and parameters should be completely and clearly explained. Obscuring how to retrieve the study data or other insecure, potentially jealous approaches of reporting will definitely undermine the dissemination of the knowledge, that is, the whole point of making the actual reporting of a scientific research.

</div>

<div align="justify">
  
Method Availability: Again, unclear methodology and software use is unfortunately not uncommon. One should make the methodology so clear that a reader and/or reviewer might be able to reproduce the SAME results using the input data and the corresponding method. 

</div>

<div align="justify">
  
Software Selection: Unless it is impossible to do so, openly and freely available, and even better, open-source software should be preferred. Subscription or payment-based softwares or similar stuff might be more user-friendly and have extensive support, yet not only it starts to be a black-box methodology, but also it has a severely reduced reporoducibility by fellow researchers and reviewers.

</div>

<div align="justify">
  
Publication/report availability: "Free as in beer" respectable journals with open access policies should be a preferred way of scientific result communication while conducting a research study with FIRE Araştırma Eğitim Ltd. Şti. resources. For conference presentations, at the very least the abstract should be available with clear indication of methods and data sources.

## Data Protection - General Data Protection Regulation - Kişisel Verilerin Korunması Kanunu

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union sourced regulation. Full-text can be retrieved from [here](https://gdpr-info.eu/).

For the citizens of Türkiye, ["Kişisel Verilerin Korunması Kanunu"](https://kvkk.gov.tr/) is a close counterpart of GDPR. 

<div align="justify">
  
It is crucial to comply with these regulations as not only it is a good practice, but also serious penalties and fines might originate from potentially harmless-looking misconducts. A guideline will be prepared with the support of expert attorneys on this critical issue. Until that time, reading the full-texts from their sources is the safest option.

</div>

<div align="justify">
  
Moreover, additional licenses, copyright issues, and terms of uses should be carefully checked for every data, code, software, text utilization. As for FIRE Araştırma Eğitim Ltd. Şti., the materials used and/or published are either self-sourced or public license, and expected to be so. 

</div>

## Research Ethics

<div align="justify">
  
As of March 2024, FIRE Araştırma Eğitim Ltd. Şti. finds it adequate to follow the guidelines of Council of Science Editors on research publication specific ethical issues in reporting scientific outputs. Full text of the up-to-date version can be retrieved below:
[Council of Science Editors' Guidelines](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/recommendations-for-promoting-integrity-in-scientific-journal-publications)

</div>

<div align="justify">
  
In general, plagiarism, data fabrication and falsification, improper or nonexistent citation/acknowledgment of scientific research and data, incorrect authorship assignment practices (e.g. authorship without any contribution to the study) and many other problems, in fact against the common sense, are prohibited from the Company's perspective, too. Data, publication, image, or any other resources' copyright and licenses should be in line with the use purposes of them in the corresponding research study.
