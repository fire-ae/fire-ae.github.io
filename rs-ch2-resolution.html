<h1 id="remote-sensing-resolutions">Remote Sensing Resolutions</h1>

<h2 id="spatial-resolution">Spatial Resolution</h2>

<p>Spatial resolution refers to the smallest object that a sensor can

detect on the ground, typically expressed as the size of a single pixel

in the image. For instance, a spatial resolution of 1 meter means that

one pixel represents a 1x1 meter area on the ground. High spatial

resolution is crucial for applications requiring detailed imagery, such

as urban planning or precision agriculture. Conversely, low spatial

resolution is often acceptable for applications like weather monitoring,

where broad coverage is more important than fine detail. Advances in

satellite technologies have significantly improved spatial resolution,

with some modern systems achieving sub-meter resolution. However, higher

resolution often comes at the cost of reduced coverage area, low

radiometric resolution or increased data volume. Selecting an

appropriate spatial resolution depends on the specific requirements of

the study or application<span class="citation"

data-cites="smith2007remote"></span>.</p>

<h2 id="spectral-resolution">Spectral Resolution</h2>

<p>Spectral resolution defines a sensor’s ability to distinguish between

different wavelengths of light, typically measured by the number and

width of spectral bands. Sensors with high spectral resolution, such as

hyperspectral sensors, can detect subtle differences in material

properties by capturing hundreds of narrow spectral bands. This

capability is essential for applications like vegetation analysis,

mineral mapping, and water quality assessment. In contrast,

multispectral sensors, with fewer and broader bands, are suitable for

general-purpose imaging and cost-effective monitoring. Higher spectral

resolution, however, often involves trade-offs, such as increased data

complexity and processing requirements. Recent technological

advancements have enabled better integration of spectral data with

machine learning techniques, enhancing analytical precision. Selecting

the right spectral resolution involves balancing the need for detailed

spectral information with the constraints of data storage and processing

capabilities<span class="citation"

data-cites="jensen2000remote"></span>.</p>

<h2 id="radiometric-resolution">Radiometric Resolution</h2>

<p>Radiometric resolution describes a sensor’s ability to measure

variations in the intensity of radiation it receives. It is determined

by the number of bits used to represent the data, with higher bit depths

allowing finer discrimination between intensity levels. For example, an

8-bit sensor can distinguish 256 levels, while a 16-bit sensor can

differentiate over 65,000 levels. This resolution is critical for

detecting subtle variations in reflectance, particularly in applications

like thermal imaging or climate studies. Higher radiometric resolution

enhances the sensor’s ability to detect slight changes in surface

properties, enabling more precise analysis. However, it also results in

larger data sizes, requiring efficient storage and processing

strategies. The choice of radiometric resolution depends on the study’s

sensitivity requirements and data handling capabilities. Recent

innovations are pushing the boundaries, enabling more precise

radiometric analyses in remote sensing<span class="citation"

data-cites="campbell2002introduction"></span>.<br />

In general, there are trade-offs between choosing a higher spatial

resolution, higher spectral resolution, and higher radiometric

resolution, where increasing one will decrease the other two.</p>

<h2 id="temporal-resolution">Temporal Resolution</h2>

<p>Temporal resolution, also called revisit time, refers to the

frequency with which a sensor captures images of the same area, often

measured in days. It is a critical factor for monitoring dynamic

processes, such as vegetation growth, urban expansion, or disaster

response. High temporal resolution, such as daily or sub-daily revisits,

allows for near-real-time analysis, making it essential for applications

like weather forecasting and crop monitoring. Conversely, low temporal

resolution is sufficient for studies requiring long-term trend analysis,

such as glacier retreat or deforestation. Advances in satellite

constellations, such as those by commercial providers, have drastically

improved temporal resolution by enabling multiple revisits per day.

However, higher temporal resolution often involves trade-offs in spatial

or spectral resolution due to system limitations. Balancing these

resolutions is key to designing effective monitoring strategies.

Emerging technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or CubeSat

satellite chains, further complement satellite systems, enhancing

temporal resolution for localized studies<span class="citation"

<h2 id="combination-of-resolutions">Combination of Resolutions</h2>

<p>To analyze if an object can be resolved by a sensor, we evaluate the

spatial, radiometric, and spectral criteria:</p>

<h3 id="spatial-resolution-1">Spatial Resolution</h3>

<p>An object is resolvable if its dimension (<span

class="math inline">\(D\)</span>) is larger than the sensor’s Ground

Sampling Distance (GSD): <span class="math display">\[D \geq \text{GSD}

= \frac{H}{f} \cdot p\]</span></p>

<h3 id="radiometric-resolution-1">Radiometric Resolution</h3>

<p>Contrast between the object and background is essential. The object

is resolvable if: <span class="math display">\[C = \frac{I_{\text{obj}}

- I_{\text{background}}}{I_{\text{background}}} \geq

\frac{1}{2^n}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is

the sensor’s radiometric resolution in bits.</p>

<h3 id="spectral-resolution-1">Spectral Resolution</h3>

<p>Two objects are resolvable spectrally if the difference in their

wavelengths exceeds the sensor’s bandwidth: <span

class="math display">\[\Delta \lambda \leq |\lambda_1 -

\lambda_2|\]</span></p>

<h3 id="combined-resolving-condition">Combined Resolving Condition</h3>

<p>An object can be resolved when all conditions are satisfied: <span

class="math display">\[D \geq \text{GSD}, \quad C \geq \frac{1}{2^n},

\quad \Delta \lambda \leq |\lambda_1 - \lambda_2|\]</span> This combined

analysis improves our understanding of sensor capabilities and the

limits of detectability.</p>

<h1 id="current-remote-sensing-missions">Current Remote Sensing

Missions</h1>

<p>We can roughly categorize current missions as active and passive

remote sensing operations. The active ones are radar and lidar, while

the passive ones are multispectral/hyperspectral, thermal, and

accelerometer-based ones. Active remote sensing can operate both day and

night, and in the case of radar, it can also penetrate clouds and

provide virtually gap-free dataset on its revisit time. Passive remote

sensing collects the light reflected from the surface or region/object

of interest (except accelerometer where no light is collected, but the

acceleration or deceleration of the twin satellite is the measure) and

require cloud-free conditions.</p>

<h2 id="multispectral-imaging-msi">Multispectral Imaging (MSI)</h2>

<p>Multispectral imaging has multiple, but not so many, different

wavelength windows in their sensors and record the light in these

windows in separete detectors. Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite series

(especially Landsat-5 and 8, and Sentinel-2) have been widely used MSI

missions providing consistent global data<span class="citation"

data-cites="drusch2012sentinel"></span>.</p>

<h2 id="accelerometer">Accelerometer</h2>

<p>Accelerometer missions like GRACE measure gravity field variations,

aiding hydrology and geophysics<span class="citation"

data-cites="tapley2004grace"></span>. Comparatively, they are the lowest

altitude orbit satellites among earth observation satellites.</p>

<h2 id="hyperspectral-imaging">Hyperspectral Imaging</h2>

<p>This kind of remote sensing technique is the most similar to taking a

spectrum of a material in the laboratory, with quite narrow wavelength

windows and high number of different bins to distinguish even minute

dissimilarities. Even though low number of missions and even lower

amount of data are available, they are of very high value in

classification tasks. The HySIS mission by ISRO delivers hyperspectral

data for mineral exploration<span class="citation"

data-cites="kumar2020hysis"></span>.</p>

<h2 id="thermal-imaging">Thermal Imaging</h2>

<p>Another beneficial sensor gives information regarding the temperature

of the respective surface. Thermal sensors on Landsat-8 provide land

surface temperature data. Applications include urban heat mapping. <span

class="citation" data-cites="wang2020thermal"></span>.</p>

<h2 id="radar">Radar</h2>

<p>Radar is an active remote sensing operation, in which a

microwave-length light is generated and sent to the object/region of

interest and the received refleted signal from this carry different

types of information from the point of reflection. Synthetic Aperture

Radar (SAR) missions like Sentinel-1 are crucial for all-weather

observations. <span class="citation"

data-cites="torres2012sentinel1"></span>. For most tasks, the radar

signals sent and received are not influenced remarkably by clouds.</p>

<h2 id="lidar">Lidar</h2>

<p>Lidar is similar to radar, but they use 532 or 1064 nm wavelength

lasers, in which the 532 can also penetrate water to some extend. NASA’s

ICESat-2 provides high-resolution elevation data, important for

cryosphere studies. <span class="citation"

data-cites="markus2017icesat2"></span>.</p>
