## Research Project Conduct Workflow

As of March 2024, the current expected basic workflow of a Research Project of FIRE Araştırma Eğitim Ltd. Şti. follows this linear workflow (see the [Research](research.md) page for detailed and full workflow with links to the corresponding repositories, servers, and journals):

1-) Determining an area of interest within a field not foreign to the Researcher's experiences and skills.
2-) Extensive literature review, gap analysis, and reporting this gap analysis and potential future studies in a Preprint server present in [Preprint Citation Index of Clarivate](https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/preprint-citation-index/). 

This step is crucial. Even though in the first instance it might seem self-destructive, like letting others stealing a research's idea, there are two counter-arguments against this fear. The first one is that a literature review should also be a unique contribution, hence even though anybody else who reads that might have an idea of the gaps one researcher figured out after an extensive literature review, it will not be as familiar and comprehensive as the person who actually did the review itself. Hence, even an ideal case of being able to communicate everything to the audience with 100 % efficiency, it is unexpected that others will catch up to that person and eliminate the chances of making his/her scientific contribution to the field. The second thing is, reporting the gaps is different than outlining how one will approach to that gap, the data and methodology, and how one will integrate that gap and generated knowledge to the corpus of knowledge from other dimensions. To sum up, there is nothing tangible to fear here.

3-) Proving that the candidate researcher for the future project has the required resources, or that person can attain those requirements with the available support of FIRE Araştırma Eğitim Ltd. Şti. This does not require extensive methodology explanation and similar issues. Such rigidity had, in many instances of Güray Hatipoğlu's experiences, resulted in problems in reporting period expectations of the funder institution. Worse still, cases of methodology and research study stealing may be possible. Hence, The Company would rather like to see the methodology in a peer reviewed conference presentation or scientific publication in a peer-reviewed respectable journal, with of course, acknowledging the support of the Company in case it is present.

The Company aims to advance the boundaries of scientific knowledge of humanity, and this mandates the availability and accessibility of the outputs. A directory of respectable  open-access journals in different fiels, not requiring an article processing charge or anything of the sort will be kept up-to-date and the contracted researchers will be expected to publish their research in them, or at the very least, in such journals. In other words, researchers might suggest addition of a journal to the list and make her/his publications in that place. 
Furthermore, a separate document and guidelines will be provided for accessibility. Currently, color-blind friendly images, clearly captioned graphs, tables, and figures, and a well-written manuscript will be considered sufficiently accessible.

4-) Until any other update, when Step 3 is complete, the authors/researchers will be deemed successful and this will be an important assessment criterion in deciding future fund requests


## Research Ethics

As of March 2024, FIRE Araştırma Eğitim Ltd. Şti. finds it adequate to follow the guidelines of Council of Science Editors on research publication specific ethical issues in reporting scientific outputs. Full text of the up-to-date version can be retrieved below:
[Council of Science Editors' Guidelines](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/recommendations-for-promoting-integrity-in-scientific-journal-publications)

In general, plagiarism, data fabrication and falsification, improper or nonexistent citation/acknowledgment of scientific research and data, incorrect authorship assignment practices (e.g. authorship without any contribution to the study) and many other problems, in fact against the common sense, are prohibited from the Company's perspective, too. Data, publication, image, or any other resources' copyright and licenses should be in line with the use purposes of them in the corresponding research study.
